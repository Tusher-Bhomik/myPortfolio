            <p>Conventional maternal marker-based prenatal tests such as triple tests, quad tests and integrated tests carry a high false positive rate of 5% or more. This means that of those who were diagnosed as high risk through these tests, only 2 to 3 percent of them actually have Down syndrome. The rest of the group are perfectly normal but were misdiagnosed as part of the high risk group.</p>
